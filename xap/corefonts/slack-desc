# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

corefonts: corefonts (TrueType core fonts for the web)
corefonts:
corefonts: The corefonts package contains the 'TrueType core fonts for the web'
corefonts: that were once available from
corefonts: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/.
corefonts: The SlackBuild script will download the actual font archives from
corefonts: Sourceforge's site at build time. Therefore this package technically
corefonts: does not 'redistribute' the fonts, it just makes it easy to install
corefonts: them on a linux system.
