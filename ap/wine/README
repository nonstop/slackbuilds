Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

If your video card does not support hardware-accelerated OpenGL, then run the
script like this:  OPENGL=NO ./wine.SlackBuild

If you wish to apply an unoffical patch that might fix up some problems
running IE in wine, then do this: IEFIX=YES ./wine.SlackBuild

If you want to use the fallout3 patch to fix problems with nvidia cards while
running this game, then do this: FALLOUT3=YES ./wine.SlackBuild

If you want to apply the DIB engine patches use DIB=YES ./wine.SlackBuild.
You will need to download the DIB patches beforehand using something like
wget -O dibeng-max.zip http://bugs.winehq.org/attachment.cgi?id=29994

These options can be used together.

This requires fontforge and webcore-fonts.

NOTE: This will not build on a stock 64bit Slackware system, and we do not
      support doing so with 32bit-compatibility packages.  That doesn't mean
      that it won't work - we just don't support it at all.
