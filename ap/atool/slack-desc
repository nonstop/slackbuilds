# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' 
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary
# to leave one space after the ':'.

atool: atool (Commandline Tool for Managing File Archives of various Types)
atool:
atool: atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
atool: tar+gzip, zip, etc).The main command is probably 'aunpack' which 
atool: extracts files from an archive. It overcomes the dreaded "multiple
atool: files in archive root" problem by first extracting to a unique
atool: subdirectory, and then moving back the files if possible.
atool: aunpack also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.
atool: Other commands provided are apack (for creating archives),
atool: als (for listing files in archives), and acat (for extracting files
atool: to stdout).
