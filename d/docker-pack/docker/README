Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers from any application.  The same container
that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in
production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and
more.

To use docker as a limited user, add your user to the 'docker' group:

  # groupadd -r -g 281 docker
  # usermod -a -G docker <your_username>

This will require logging out and back in and also restarting docker
daemon.

To have the docker daemon start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.docker start
  fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.docker stop
  fi

If you are interested in enabling cgroup memory resource control over
swap as well, then append "swapaccount=1" to your kernel's parameters.
This is often in /etc/lilo.conf, on the "append" variable.

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not needed for
runtime.

Docker doesn't support x86, only x86_64.
