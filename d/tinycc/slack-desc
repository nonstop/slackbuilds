tcc: tcc - Tiny C Compiler
tcc:
tcc: TCC (for Tiny C Compiler) is a small, fast, unlimited and safe ANSI C
tcc: compiler. It generates optimized x86 code, and can compile, assemble
tcc: and link several times faster than `gcc -O0'. Any C dynamic library
tcc: can be used directly. It includes an optional memory and bounds
tcc: checker, and bounds-checked code can be mixed freely with standard
tcc: code. C script is also supported via the usual hash-bang mechanism.
