nginx [engine x] is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

By default, nginx will use the "nobody" user and group accounts. You may
specify alternate values on the command line if desired; for example:

	NGINXUSER=backup NGINXGROUP=backup ./nginx.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to make
sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.

Note that there are potential security concerns with allowing logrotate
(which runs as root) to operate on directories/files that a non-root user
controls, but there's not a good alternative for now.  Newer versions of
logrotate (3.8.0+) have an "su" option that can be used, but it's not
available in Slackware 13.37.
